            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But not being content, or ſatisfied with that which they have moſt wickedly and barbarouſly taken, they beginne to thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the County of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and had a great deſire to viſite the ſaid County, and ſo they concluded to have done, for about 3000. of their Horſe and Foot, conſented together, and marched towards <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where they had thought to have inriched themſelves very much, but their hopes were quite fruſtrated, neither could their deſignes take any effect.</p>

            <p> For when the Jnhabitants of the ſaid Shire had information, and ſaw that the Cavaliers were reſolved to come into their County, they with all expedition rayſed the Trayned-Bands and all other Forces that poſſibly they could, and alſo ſent to all the other adjoyning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to aid and asſiſt them in this Deſigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cavaliers, that were comming to ranſacke and pillage them of all they had, and for feare they ſhould have a feeling of their miſeries, which they were like to undergo, if that the Deſigne of the Cavaliers tooke effect.</p>
            <p>But before they could come to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Jnhabitants thereof had rayſed a great Power, inſomuch that they did not feare the Cavaliers, nor all their threatning ſpeeches, but at laſt about fifteen-hundred made their approach nere to the ſaid County, and began to put in execution their moſt damnable and wicked projects, whereupon the Jnhabitants having rayſed a great ſtrength, to the number of two thouland, advanced toward the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, but no ſooner did theſe wicked catiffs ſe the Forces of the ſaid County comming, but they beganne to retreate, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſlight, not daring to give Battaile to

            <p>Jn <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> at <hi>VVatford,</hi> they made the like attemt, but their deſigne could not take effect, for the inhabitants of the ſaid Towne and County, aroſe and muſtered their Forces together, and advanced toward their Enemies and gave them the ſame entertainment, that their confederates had about <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> for when they thought that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to incounter with them, they likewiſe betooke themſelves to their Heels.</p>
